				<h2>Why should I buy services?</h2>
				<p>
					Short answer: <strong>Save time and get better game experience</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In most MMORPGs, players usually need to spend a lot of time on repetitive quests to gain experience,
					pets, gears and so on. And the game guild's schedule usually conflicts with work and school schedules,
					so players don't get to participate in the most up-to-date activities, such as Raid, as they would like.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore, we allow you to take advantage of our service to participate in
					these game contents anytime, anywhere and get the corresponding or even additional rewards! And, our
					team will never force you to play a character you don't like, you can join our Raid and other
					game teams with any character you are currently playing.
